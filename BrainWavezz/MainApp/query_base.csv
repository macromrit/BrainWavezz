In how many ways can a committee of 4 members be formed from a group of 10 people, consisting of 5 men and 5 women, if the committee must have at least 2 men and at least 2 women?|To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. <br><br>First, let's consider the different cases for the committee composition:<br><br>Case 1: 2 men and 2 women<br>In this case, we need to choose 2 men from the 5 available men and 2 women from the 5 available women. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(5, 2) * C(5, 2) = 10 * 10 = 100.<br><br>Case 2: 3 men and 1 woman<br>In this case, we need to choose 3 men from the 5 available men and 1 woman from the 5 available women. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(5, 3) * C(5, 1) = 10 * 5 = 50.<br><br>Case 3: 1 man and 3 women<br>In this case, we need to choose 1 man from the 5 available men and 3 women from the 5 available women. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(5, 1) * C(5, 3) = 5 * 10 = 50.<br><br>Case 4: 4 men<br>In this case, we need to choose 4 men from the 5 available men. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(5, 4) = 5.<br><br>Case 5: 4 women<br>In this case, we need to choose 4 women from the 5 available women. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(5, 4) = 5.<br><br>Now, we can calculate the total number of ways to form the committee by summing up the number of ways for each case: 100 + 50 + 50 + 5 + 5 = 210.|The committee can be formed in 210 different ways.

Find the sum of the first 10 terms of a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous three terms, starting with the terms 1, 2, and 3.|To find the sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence, we need to first determine the sequence itself. <br><br>The given sequence starts with the terms 1, 2, and 3. Each subsequent term is the sum of the previous three terms. <br><br>So, the sequence can be written as: 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 230, ...<br><br>To find the sum of the first 10 terms, we can simply add up the first 10 terms of the sequence.|The sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 11 + 20 + 37 + 68 + 125 + 230 = 503.
Find the equation of a line passing through the point (3, 4) and perpendicular to the line 2x - 3y + 5 = 0.|To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, we need to find the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line.<br><br>First, let's rearrange the equation of the given line in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.<br>2x - 3y + 5 = 0<br>-3y = -2x - 5<br>y = (2/3)x + 5/3<br><br>The slope of the given line is 2/3. To find the slope of the line perpendicular to it, we take the negative reciprocal of 2/3, which is -3/2.<br><br>Now, we have the slope (-3/2) and a point (3, 4) that the line passes through. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line.<br>y - y1 = m(x - x1)<br><br>Substituting the values, we get:<br>y - 4 = (-3/2)(x - 3)<br><br>Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:<br>y - 4 = (-3/2)x + 9/2<br>y = (-3/2)x + 9/2 + 4<br>y = (-3/2)x + 9/2 + 8/2<br>y = (-3/2)x + 17/2|The equation of the line passing through the point (3, 4) and perpendicular to the line 2x - 3y + 5 = 0 is y = (-3/2)x + 17/2.

In a three-dimensional coordinate system, consider a line passing through the points P(2, 3, 4) and Q(5, 1, -2). Find the equation of the plane that is perpendicular to this line and passes through the point (1, -1, 2).|To find the equation of a plane, we need a point on the plane and a normal vector to the plane. <br><br>First, let's find the direction vector of the line passing through points P(2, 3, 4) and Q(5, 1, -2). We can find the direction vector by subtracting the coordinates of the two points:<br><br>Direction vector = Q - P = (5, 1, -2) - (2, 3, 4) = (3, -2, -6)<br><br>Next, we need to find a normal vector to the plane. Since the plane is perpendicular to the line, the direction vector of the line will be parallel to the normal vector of the plane. Therefore, the normal vector of the plane is the same as the direction vector of the line, which is (3, -2, -6).<br><br>Now, we have a point on the plane, which is (1, -1, 2), and a normal vector to the plane, which is (3, -2, -6).

A suitcase has a number lock with 4 wheels, each labeled with 10 digits from 0 to 9. The lock can be opened if a specific sequence of 4 digits is entered, with no repetition. If the first digit is 7, how many possible sequences of 3 digits must be checked in order to open the lock?|Since the first digit is fixed as 7, we have 1 option for the first digit. For the remaining 3 digits, we have 10 options each (0-9). Therefore, the total number of possible sequences of 3 digits is 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000.|1000
In a certain game, a player rolls a fair six-sided die twice. What is the probability of rolling a prime number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll?|To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of rolling a prime number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. <br><br>Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die twice. Since each roll has 6 possible outcomes, the total number of outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36.<br><br>Step 2: Determine the number of outcomes where the first roll is a prime number. The prime numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, there are 3 possible outcomes for the first roll.<br><br>Step 3: Determine the number of outcomes where the second roll is an even number. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2 and 4. Therefore, there are 2 possible outcomes for the second roll.<br><br>Step 4: Determine the number of outcomes where both conditions are satisfied. Since the first roll has 3 possible outcomes and the second roll has 2 possible outcomes, the total number of outcomes where both conditions are satisfied is 3 * 2 = 6.<br><br>Step 5: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of outcomes where both conditions are satisfied by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability is 6/36 = 1/6.|The probability of rolling a prime number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is 1/6.

Let R be the relation on set A defined by R = {(x, y) : x is a prime number less than 10 and y is the cube of x}. Determine the domain and range of R, and find the number of relations from the domain of R to the range of R.|To determine the domain and range of the relation R, we need to find all the possible values of x and y that satisfy the given condition.<br><br>1. Domain of R:<br>The domain of R is the set of all possible values of x. In this case, x is a prime number less than 10. The prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, the domain of R is {2, 3, 5, 7}.<br><br>2. Range of R:<br>The range of R is the set of all possible values of y. In this case, y is the cube of x. So, for each value of x in the domain, we need to calculate its cube. Let's calculate the cubes of the prime numbers less than 10:<br>- For x = 2, y = 2^3 = 8<br>- For x = 3, y = 3^3 = 27<br>- For x = 5, y = 5^3 = 125<br>- For x = 7, y = 7^3 = 343<br>Therefore, the range of R is {8, 27, 125, 343}.<br><br>3. Number of relations from the domain of R to the range of R:<br>To find the number of relations from the domain of R to the range of R, we need to calculate the Cartesian product of the domain and range. Since the domain has 4 elements and the range has 4 elements, the number of relations is equal to the number of ordered pairs that can be formed from these elements, which is 4 * 4 = 16.|Domain of R: {2, 3, 5, 7}<br>Range of R: {8, 27, 125, 343}<br>Number of relations from the domain of R to the range of R: 16

In a certain game, a player rolls a fair six-sided die three times. The player wins if the sum of the three numbers rolled is a multiple of 5. What is the probability of winning the game?|To solve this problem, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.<br><br>Let's start by finding the total number of possible outcomes. Since the player rolls a fair six-sided die three times, there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

In this case, the set A has 7 elements.<br><br>The power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets of that set. The cardinality of the power set of A can be found using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set A. In this case, the cardinality of the power set of A is 2^7 = 128.<br><br>To find the number of subsets of A that contain exactly 3 elements and are not empty, we can use the combination formula. The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is given by the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of objects and r is the number of objects we want to choose.
